EVE-Mail from Deuce Syundai:  
  
>Sarah's Overview was the start of all this years ago, made by Sarah Schneider formerly of PonyWaffe, which was part of Test Alliance Please Ignore before it failcascaded in late 2013.  
  
>Sarah's Overview was one of the standard overviews in TEST.  
In early 2014 Sarah seemed to go silent.  
  
>Oh Takashawa took up the task of updating the pack for the new Overview system CCP rolled out, changing it from XML to YAML and allowing overview setups to be shared in-game.  
He pioneered breaking down the large overview into multiple packs, originally sharing them in his bio before making the channel and mailing lists.  
  
>Before sharing overviews, all you could share was an .xml file hosted on EVE Files loaded with presets and tabs, you had to do all the colortags and backgrounds and ordering yourself.  
  
>When Oh Takashawa didn't release an update for 118.6 to include the new entities introduced for Shadow of the Serpant, Zirio decided to update the pack himself, and sought feedback during the process.  
He didn't know at the time the tricks Oh Takashawa had to pull off to load that many presets, so it was an interesting time of trial and error that eventually led to the modular installation we have now.  
  
>But for me, when he pulled me in in June, he wanted input on making sure everything worked as intended, and I offered feedback on taking the opportunity to make things look better.  
I pointed out I had actually made a modded version of Sarah's Overview .xml back in the day called the Syundai Specialâ„¢ that pioneered the color-coded presets in our pack now.  
  
>But the nature of overviews being more difficult to distribute at the time meant it was harder to get the word out. Also I suck at coding so updating it every time CCP made changes was really difficult for me to manage. When the switch was made to YAML I couldn't get it to work at all. So the last and most clicked-on version of my modded pack got just 65 downloads.  
  
>This is why 650 mailing list members is such a milestone for me personally.  
What does this mean?  
  
>It means we're giving 6.5mil ISK to each of 65 randomly selected members of our mailing list who were subscribed at the time we crossed over 650 subscribers earlier today!
