##### Version v3.06.0523 - 118.7 - _Strawpoll results tweaks_
>1. Added a new `Z-S Full Unstylized Presets.yaml` import file.
    - It'll allow the player to save any changes to the presets without breaking the preset name entirely.
        - Will not show styling tags anymore (`<color>` & `<fontsize>`).
        - The presets will have the Default colouring.
        - The presets will have the Default font size.
    - Currently when a player saves an edited preset, the system prompts to input a name for it. The input field's character limit will cut some pre-added names.
    - The file will only be available via download from GitHub and the player will have to import it manually into the game.
        - This will avoid creating a new Mailing List and Channel due to character limits in both the Welcoming Mail and MOTD respectively.
    - We will contact CCP regarding a small update to the Overview input fields that will allow to:
        - ~~Input longer names.~~ Coming on the September 2016 release.
        - ~~Input Capital letters.~~ Coming on the September 2016 release.
        - Input styling tags (`<color>` & `<fontsize>`). Not yet, difficult to implement.
