# Zirio-Syundai Special Overview
### Overview Pack for EVE Online

The Zirio-Syundai Special™ Overview was created to provide a generalized, user-friendly, 6- or 8-tab overview, ready to use as-is with room to be tailored as needed.
What started as a stop-gap measure to bring the SaraShawa overview up-to-date for 118.6 instead snowballed into a complete re-write of the .yaml file and [total overhaul of the visuals.](http://prntscr.com/br0lar)
If you're familiar with SaraShawa, it shouldn't take too long to adjust to the changes.

##### New features include:
- Choice of Full-Size or Compact 6- or 8-Tab Layouts that can be swapped at any time without reloading the entire pack.
- Modular Setup: Load the Preset Packs you need, not the ones you don't.
- New presets, including dedicated Faction Warfare and Incursion presets.
- [Color-coded presets by category for improved ease of selection.](http://prntscr.com/br0kp1)

### How to install
#### Option 1: In-game, from "Zirio-Syundai Overview" chat channel:
1. Open up your Overview Settings ( ≡ button at top left of the Overview window).
2. Go to the "Misc" tab and click "Reset All Overview Settings." You MUST do this the first time you install. This prevents any weirdness that may be caused by any changes already made to the overview.
3. Apply the Z-S Core preset pack FIRST. This is the only preset pack required. When combined with a Tab Layout, it includes the following presets:
	- All Travel, Warpout, D-scan, and Bracket presets
	- PvE: Basic and PvE: Salvage/Loot
	- PvP: Basic and Target: Drones
	- Friendly: All and Friendly: Fleet
4. (Optional) Apply any of these Optional preset packs you may need for more specialized presets:
	- Z-S PvE contains presets for Anoms/Ratting, Incursion, Mining, and Show Drones.
	- Z-S PvP Basic contains presets for Faction Warfare, Ships Only, Bombing Warpouts, Deployables, NPSI, Structures, and Wartargets.
	- Z-S PvP Extended packs include presets for specific categories from Fighters to Frigates to Logi to Titans. Each pack contains half the categories and should be installed together.
	- Z-S Friendly Extended includes presets for Capitals, Supercapitals, Carriers, Dictors, Dreads, Logi, and Recon.
5. To finish and set up the tabs, apply a Tab Layout. Standard has each tab named for a purpose, and Compact replaces most of the names with numbers or sorter names for reduced tab width.
	- You can alternate between Layouts at any time without reloading the entire pack.
	- _Some features might not show correctly at first, It may be necessary to Dock and then Undock at any station to reload the UI to apply all changes._

#### Option 2: Out of game:
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button located at the top right of the above file list, then click "Download ZIP".
2. Once downloaded in the folder of your preference, extract the .zip file contents in a folder of your preference.
3. Go to the most recent version folder and copy the "Zirio-Syundai Full.yaml" file.
4. Go to "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\EVE\Overview" and paste the downloaded file here.
5. Start the game and open up your Overview Settings ( ≡ button at top left of the Overview window).
6. Go to the "Misc" tab and click "Import Overview Settings".
7. Select "Zirio-Syundai Full" on the left list and click "Check All" on the top middle, then click "Import".
	- _Some features might not show correctly at first, It may be necessary to Dock and then Undock at any station to reload the UI to apply all changes._
