# Z-S Overview Pack
### Overview Pack for EVE Online

The Z-S Overview was created to provide a generalized, user-friendly, 6-Tab Overview, ready to use as-is with room to be tailored as needed.

What started as a stop-gap measure back in early 2016 to bring the SaraShawa Overview up-to-date for 118.6, snowballed into a complete re-write of the .YAML file and total overhaul of the visuals in July 2016 for the first installment.

If you're familiar with SaraShawa, it shouldn't take too long to adjust to the changes.

**Zirio** - YAML Coding & Pack Maintenence  
**Deuce Syundai** - Design & Text Formatting

##### New features include:

- Choice of Full-Size or Compact 6-Tab Layouts that can be swapped at any time without reloading the entire pack.
- Modular Setup: Load the Preset Packs you need.
- New and ever evolving presets for all activities on EVE, including dedicated Faction Warfare and Incursion presets among others.
- Color-coded presets by category for improved ease of selection.

#### Current Version: v5.11.0424

- Updated: **2017.01.01**
- For Release: **118.10**
- Compatible: **119.3**

- We expect the **player to have a minimal understanding on how the Overview System works** before attempting to install Z-S and/or any other 3rd party Overview Pack.


- Be sure to check our **[FAQ](https://github.com/Arziel1992/Z-S-Overview-Pack/blob/master/FAQ.md)** to solve the most common issues you might find when attempting to install and/or edit Z-S Overview Pack.

#### Method 1: Video Tutorials

- **OR** Follow this **[Quick Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJApc_E66Es)** kindly made by **AHandinit Flo** - [English]

#### Method 2: In-game, from `Z-S Overview` chat channel

1. Open up your Overview Settings ( ≡ button at top left of the Overview window).  
![Step 1](Images/Step_1a.png "Step 1")

2. Go to the "Misc" tab and click `Reset All Overview Settings`  
![Step 2](Images/Step_1b.png "Step 2")  
    - You **MUST** do this the first time you install.
    - This prevents any weirdness that may be caused by any changes already made to the overview.

3. Apply the `Z-S Core` preset pack FIRST by clicking on its link.  
This is the only **required** preset pack.  
When combined with a Tab Layout, it includes the following presets for a minimal setup:
	- Core Presets  
    ![Core + Layout](Images/Core_+_Layout.png "Core Presets")  
	- All **Travel**, **Warpout** & **Brackets** presets
	- **PvE: Basic** & **PvE: Salvage/Loot**
	- **PvP: Basic** & **Target: Drones**
	- **Friendly: All** & **Friendly Fleet**
	- **D-Scan: All**

4. (Optional) Apply any of the following Optional preset packs by clicking on their links.  
You may need them for more specialized presets:
	- `Z-S PvE Extended` contains presets for Anoms/Ratting, Incursion, Mining, and Show Drones.
	- `Z-S PvP Basic` contains presets for Faction Warfare, Ships Only, Bombing Warpouts, Deployables, NPSI, Structures, and Wartargets.
	- `Z-S PvP Extended` packs include Target presets for specific categories, from Fighters to Frigates to Logi to Titans. Each pack contains half the categories and should be installed together.
	- `Z-S Friendly Extended` includes presets for Capitals, Supercapitals, Carriers, Dictors, Dreads, Logi, and Recon.
	- `Z-S D-Scan Extended` contains more finely-tuned presets specifically for the D-Scan filter.
	- _You can go back to add in additional packs at any time without reloading the entire pack. Simply click on a pack to add, then repeat step 5 below._
	- Note the instructions on the tab.  
    
    ![Pack Loaded](Images/Pack_Loaded.png "Pack Loaded!")  
    ![PvP Basic](Images/PvP_Basic.png "Basic Full Loadout")  ![PvP Extended](Images/PvP_Extended.png "Extended Full Loadout")  

5. To finish and set up the tabs, apply a Tab Layout by clicking on their links.  
Standard has each tab named for a purpose, and Compact replaces most of the names with numbers or shorter names for reduced tab width.  
2BL denotes 2 Bracket Lines, while 1BL denotes 1 Bracket Line.
 - `Standard` tab layout  
 ![Standard Tabs](Images/Standard_Tabs.png "Standard")  
 - `Compact` tab layout  
 ![Compact Tabs](Images/Compact_Tabs.png "Compact")  
 - `1BL` Brackets  
 ![1 Bracket Line](Images/1_Bracket_Line.png "1BL") 
 - `2BL` Brackets  
 ![2 Bracket Lines](Images/2_Bracket_Lines.png "2BL")   
	- You can alternate between Layouts at any time without reloading the entire pack by clicking on their links.
	- _Some features might not show correctly at first, it may be necessary to open the Overview Settings again, then select the Ships tab to reload the UI to force a resync and apply all changes._

3. Go to the most recent version folder and:
    - Copy the `Z-S Full Stylized.yaml` file for the complete pre-stylized overview.
    - Or copy the `Z-S Full Unstylized.yaml` file for the complete default-style overview.
    - Or copy the specific packs you want/need, alongside one or all layouts.

4. Go to `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\EVE\Overview` folder and paste the copied files there.
    - If the folder doesn't exist, you can either create it manually.
    - Or export your current overview (recommended) and it will be created automatically.
        - To export, follow step 5-6.
        - Instead of import, choose export and mark `Check All`
        - This will save your current overview and its settings.

6. Go to the `Misc` tab:
    - Click `Reset All` to have the default settings loaded.
