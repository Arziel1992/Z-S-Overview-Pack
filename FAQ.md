## FAQ (WIP)
#### Send suggestions for more FAQ's!

- ##### How do you evaluate what entity types are useful for each preset?
> We check the tactical benefit of said entity VS the cluttering it causes on both the Overview Window List and the Ship Brackets.  
> If we aren't sure about the cost/benefit, we will usually:
> - Ask for direct feedback on the chat chanel.
> - Summon testers to evaluate a pre-build and reach a consensus.
> - Run a Strawpoll.

- ##### If I click "Save" to commit the changes, the preset name will not save properly.
> Sadly the game has a character limit on the Name's input field in addition to some other restrictions:
> - Character limit.
> - Cannot input capital letters.
> - Cannot input HTML tags (`<color>` & `<fontsize>`).
> There is not an easy solution to this aside from saving as a new preset with default style and shorter name.  
> The "not so easy" solution is to save the preset "as is", export the Overview Profile and edit the Preset name on the .YAML file directly.  
> We will reach out to CCP to suggest a small feature patch to widen/remove these limits.

- ##### My Ship Brackets aren't loading?
> This is a known issue due to bad a sync between the Overview profile and the game.  
> To fix it you need to open your "Overview Settings" window and cycle a few times between the menu tabs, this will force a resync.

- ##### How to give you feedback?
> The prefered method is to use the **Feedback Link** highlighted next to the **Green Text** both in the **MOTD** and the **Mailing List Welcoming Mail**.  
> Other methods are:
> - EVE-Mail **Zirio**.
> - Write a comment on the **[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4s3z9i/introducing_the_ziriosyundai_special_overview_pack/)** thread.
> - Message **Zirio** on **[Slack](https://tweetfleet.slack.com/messages/zs-overview-dev/)**.

- ##### How can I add/update/remove "X" entity(s) on a preset? (G)

> Or open your Overview settings window, go to the "Tab Presets" tab, and then the "Types" sub-tab.  
> Either use the filter to locate the specific entity or look through the list, then check/uncheck the entity(s) you want.

- ##### How can I add/update/remove "X" state(s) on a preset? (G)
